* To comment a line use # or command+/

1. Print
    To print a line use print("Whatever is needed to be printed")
    Double quotes are used to show to start and end of the string
    We can use single quotes instead of the double quotes
    The type of quote used at the start is considered as start of the printable string
    To combine two strings use a '+' sign. Eg: print("Hello " + "World") 
    To print a new line use backslash n: '\n'

2. Input
    To input any value use input("Prompt")
      The prompt will be printed before user gives the input
    To use print with input: print("Hello " + input("What is your name\n") + "!")
                     Output: What is your name?
                             Utkarsh
                             Hello Utkarsh!
    To save the input in a variable: x = input("What is your name\n")

3. len() 
    used to find the length of the string
    For eg: print(len("Hello World")) -> 11
            print(len(input("What is your name?))) -> What is your name?Utkarsh
                                                      7

4. Data Types:
    i) String - array of characters
                written in double quotes
                if we run - x = input("Enter your Phone number") -> The phone number will be stored as string
                we can access each character of a string using sunscripts
                    For eg: "Hello"[0]=H
                            "World"[4]=d

    ii) Integer - same defination as in mathematics
                  x = 12345 or x=12_3_45 is the same
                      underscore between the numbers is ignored
                  if we execute: print(123+345) -> 468

    iii) Float - Floating point numbers or Decimals
                 12_34.56_78 is same as 1234.5678
                 1234._5678 cannot be used or is invalid or is an error

    iv) Boolean - True or False , 0 or 1

5. type()
    used to check the type of data; whether a n integer or float or string or any
    For eg. x = 123
            print(type(x))
            Output -> <class 'int'>

6. Type Casting/Conversion:
    used to convert variables from one data type to another
    syntax - variable_name = data_type(variable or data)
    For eg: x = 123 -> y = str(x) or y = str(123)
            both will give y = "123"

7. Operations
    i) Addition - +
    ii) Subtraction - -
    iii) Multiplication - *
    iv) Division - / (default - float)
    v) Exponent - ** Eg. [2 ** 3 = 8]
    vi) Modulus - %
    vii) Floor Division - // (Rounds of values to less than or equal to the nearest integer, changes type fro float to int)

Note: round() is used to round decimals.
        For eg: round(8/3)=3
                round(8/3,2)=2.67

Note: x += 1 is x = x + 1
      x -= 1 is x = x - 1
      x *= 1 is x = x * 1
      x /= 1 is x = x / 1

8. f-String
    used to print any data type in the print function without type conversion to string
    Syntax: print(f"printable statement {variabke inside curly bracket}")
    Eg. score=0
        print(f"Your Score is {score}")  -> Your Score is 0

9. If loop
    If cond:
        if cond:
            statement1
        else:
            statement2
    elif cond:
        if cond:
            statement3
        else:
            statement4
    else:
        if cond:
            statement5
        else:
            statement6

        maintaining indentation is important.

* To comment a line use # or command+/

1. Print
    To print a line use print("Whatever is needed to be printed")
    Double quotes are used to show to start and end of the string
    We can use single quotes instead of the double quotes
    The type of quote used at the start is considered as start of the printable string
    To combine two strings use a '+' sign. Eg: print("Hello " + "World") 
    To print a new line use backslash n: '\n'

2. Input
    To input any value use input("Prompt")
      The prompt will be printed before user gives the input
    To use print with input: print("Hello " + input("What is your name\n") + "!")
                     Output: What is your name?
                             Utkarsh
                             Hello Utkarsh!
    To save the input in a variable: x = input("What is your name\n")

3. len() 
    used to find the length of the string
    For eg: print(len("Hello World")) -> 11
            print(len(input("What is your name?))) -> What is your name?Utkarsh
